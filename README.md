# BookShoppingCartMvc

This is an online bookstore. In it, you can buy books, add them to the cart, remove them from the cart, place orders, edit your own data, view the status and history of purchases, register, log in, and log out of a specific account. Additionally, this application has two roles: user and admin. If you log in with the admin address, you will have the ability to add products to the site without opening the database.

Also, an important note, before the initial launch (then comment out), be sure to uncomment the following code in the Program.cs file from lines 50 to 53. It will automatically add an administrator. The administrator's credentials are located in the Data/DbSeeder.cs folder:
Email - admin@gmail.com
Password - Admin@123

Good luck with the development of your projects!
